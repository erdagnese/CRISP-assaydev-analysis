# CRISPR-assaydev-analysis

This repository houses the scripts and datafiles for two different projects, one for the development of an assay for Renibacterium salmoninarum from sequence fragment alignments using PrimedRPA (Higgins et al 2018 https://github.com/MatthewHiggins2017/bioconda-PrimedRPA). 
Then another file directory for the development and analysis of RPA-CRISPR(Cas12a) assays modified from previoulsy developed and validated qPCR assays for three freshwater fish species: Bull trout, Pacific Lamprey and Lampetra spp (River Lamprey species).

In each file directory the annotated scripts are found in the Rmarkdown files, along with their input .csv files, and the output files the script creates for the manuscripts.

These include the data and scripts for two manuscripts which rely on similar methods and analysis, and functions which were made and used for background correction when necessary based on positive fluourescence in any NTC replicates.
